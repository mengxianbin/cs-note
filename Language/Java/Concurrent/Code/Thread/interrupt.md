     * methods of this class, then its interrupt status will be cleared and it
     * will receive an {@link InterruptedException}.
     *
     * <p> If this thread is blocked in an I/O operation upon an {@link

     * <p> If this thread is blocked in a {@link java.nio.channels.Selector}
     * then the thread's interrupt status will be set and it will return
     * immediately from the selection operation, possibly with a non-zero
     * value, just as if the selector's {@link
