/**
 * A special {@link ChannelInboundHandler} which offers an easy way to initialize a {@link Channel} once it was
 * registered to its {@link EventLoop}.
 *
 * Implementations are most often used in the context of {@link Bootstrap#handler(ChannelHandler)} ,
 * {@link ServerBootstrap#handler(ChannelHandler)} and {@link ServerBootstrap#childHandler(ChannelHandler)} to
 * setup the {@link ChannelPipeline} of a {@link Channel}.
 *
 * <pre>
 *
 * public class MyChannelInitializer extends {@link ChannelInitializer} {
 *     public void initChannel({@link Channel} channel) {
 *         channel.pipeline().addLast("myHandler", new MyHandler());
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * {@link ServerBootstrap} bootstrap = ...;
 * ...
 * bootstrap.childHandler(new MyChannelInitializer());
 * ...
 * </pre>
 * Be aware that this class is marked as {@link Sharable} and so the implementation must be safe to be re-used.
 *
 * @param <C>   A sub-type of {@link Channel}
