```man
The options are as follows:

    -A      Display information about other users' processes, including those without controlling terminals.
    -e      Identical to -A.
    -f      Display the uid, pid, parent pid, recent CPU usage, process start time, controlling tty, elapsed CPU
            usage, and the associated command.  If the -u option is also used, display the user name rather then the
            numeric uid.  When -o or -O is used to add to the display following -f, the command field is not trun-
            cated as severely as it is in other formats.
    -l      Display information associated with the following keywords: uid, pid, ppid, flags, cpu, pri, nice,
             vsz=SZ, rss, wchan, state=S, paddr=ADDR, tty, time, and command=CMD.
