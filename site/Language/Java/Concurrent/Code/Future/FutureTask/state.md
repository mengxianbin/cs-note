     * The run state of this task, initially NEW.  The run state
     * transitions to a terminal state only in methods set,
     * setException, and cancel.  During completion, state may take on
     * transient values of COMPLETING (while outcome is being set) or
     * INTERRUPTING (only while interrupting the runner to satisfy a
     * cancel(true)). Transitions from these intermediate to final
     * states use cheaper ordered/lazy writes because values are unique
     * and cannot be further modified.
     *
     * Possible state transitions:
     * NEW -> COMPLETING -> NORMAL
     * NEW -> COMPLETING -> EXCEPTIONAL
     * NEW -> CANCELLED
     * NEW -> INTERRUPTING -> INTERRUPTED
