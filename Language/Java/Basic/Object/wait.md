    /**
     * Causes the current thread to wait until it is awakened, typically
     * by being <em>notified</em> or <em>interrupted</em>, or until a
     * certain amount of real time has elapsed.
     * <p>
     * The current thread must own this object's monitor lock. See the
     * {@link #notify notify} method for a description of the ways in which
     * a thread can become the owner of a monitor lock.
     * <p>
     * This method causes the current thread (referred to here as <var>T</var>) to
     * place itself in the wait set for this object and then to relinquish any
     * and all synchronization claims on this object. Note that only the locks
     * on this object are relinquished; any other objects on which the current
     * thread may be synchronized remain locked while the thread waits.
     * <p>
     * Thread <var>T</var> then becomes disabled for thread scheduling purposes
     * and lies dormant until one of the following occurs:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Some other thread invokes the {@code notify} method for this
     * object and thread <var>T</var> happens to be arbitrarily chosen as
     * the thread to be awakened.
     * <li>Some other thread invokes the {@code notifyAll} method for this
     * object.
     * <li>Some other thread {@linkplain Thread#interrupt() interrupts}
     * thread <var>T</var>.
     * <li>The specified amount of real time has elapsed, more or less.
     * The amount of real time, in nanoseconds, is given by the expression
     * {@code 1000000 * timeoutMillis + nanos}. If {@code timeoutMillis} and {@code nanos}
     * are both zero, then real time is not taken into consideration and the
     * thread waits until awakened by one of the other causes.
     * <li>Thread <var>T</var> is awakened spuriously. (See below.)
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * The thread <var>T</var> is then removed from the wait set for this
     * object and re-enabled for thread scheduling. It competes in the
     * usual manner with other threads for the right to synchronize on the
     * object; once it has regained control of the object, all its
     * synchronization claims on the object are restored to the status quo
     * ante - that is, to the situation as of the time that the {@code wait}
     * method was invoked. Thread <var>T</var> then returns from the
     * invocation of the {@code wait} method. Thus, on return from the
     * {@code wait} method, the synchronization state of the object and of
     * thread {@code T} is exactly as it was when the {@code wait} method
     * was invoked.
     * <p>
     * A thread can wake up without being notified, interrupted, or timing out, a
     * so-called <em>spurious wakeup</em>.  While this will rarely occur in practice,
     * applications must guard against it by testing for the condition that should
     * have caused the thread to be awakened, and continuing to wait if the condition
     * is not satisfied. See the example below.
     * <p>
     * For more information on this topic, see section 14.2,
     * "Condition Queues," in Brian Goetz and others' <em>Java Concurrency
     * in Practice</em> (Addison-Wesley, 2006) or Item 69 in Joshua
     * Bloch's <em>Effective Java, Second Edition</em> (Addison-Wesley,
     * 2008).
     * <p>
     * If the current thread is {@linkplain java.lang.Thread#interrupt() interrupted}
     * by any thread before or while it is waiting, then an {@code InterruptedException}
     * is thrown.  The <em>interrupted status</em> of the current thread is cleared when
     * this exception is thrown. This exception is not thrown until the lock status of
     * this object has been restored as described above.
     *
     * @apiNote
     * The recommended approach to waiting is to check the condition being awaited in
     * a {@code while} loop around the call to {@code wait}, as shown in the example
     * below. Among other things, this approach avoids problems that can be caused
     * by spurious wakeups.

     *             obj.wait(timeoutMillis, nanos);
     *         }
     *         ... // Perform action appropriate to condition or timeout
     *     }
