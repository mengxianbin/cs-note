     * Class Worker mainly maintains interrupt control state for
     * threads running tasks, along with other minor bookkeeping.
     * This class opportunistically extends AbstractQueuedSynchronizer
     * to simplify acquiring and releasing a lock surrounding each
     * task execution.  This protects against interrupts that are
     * intended to wake up a worker thread waiting for a task from
     * instead interrupting a task being run.  We implement a simple
     * non-reentrant mutual exclusion lock rather than use
     * ReentrantLock because we do not want worker tasks to be able to
     * reacquire the lock when they invoke pool control methods like
     * setCorePoolSize.  Additionally, to suppress interrupts until
     * the thread actually starts running tasks, we initialize lock
     * state to a negative value, and clear it upon start (in
     * runWorker).
